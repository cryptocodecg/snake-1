Simple Snake Game -- built from Mary Rose Cook's template JavaScript game (https://github.com/maryrosecook/strange-loop/blob/master/worksheet.md).

To run:

Clone the repository, then in the same directory, run a simple server using the following command in Terminal:
"python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000".

Then if you navigate to localhost:8000 you will be able to to play the game.  The rules are simple: You are the snake (black dot).  You want to eat the food (red dot).  Every time you do, you gain a new body part -- just don't run into yourself, and don't run into the walls (green lines) or you die.  The game will increase in speed as you keep eating food, for added difficulty!
